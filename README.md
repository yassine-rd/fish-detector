## ‚ú® Abstract

Three species of fish that are common in aquariums belong to the genus Paracheirodon, which is a member of the family Characidae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America.

The Paracheirodon species range in size from 3 to 5 cm, are social, uninterested in other inhabitants, and living in groups of around ten individuals.

The following three members of the genus Paracheirodon are readily found in markets:

- Paracheirodon innesi
- Paracheirodon axelrodi
- Paracheirodon simulans

## üéØ Project Aim

In this work, we propose to create a custom YOLOv4 object detector to track and count the two first classes.

1. Paracheirodon innesi, alias `neon_bleu`
2. Paracheirodon axelrodi, alias `cardinalis`
